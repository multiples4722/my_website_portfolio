          <p class="text-justify">The term electronic commerce (ecommerce) refers to a business model that
               allows companies and individuals to buy and sell goods and services over the Internet. 
             Ecommerce operates in four major market segments and can be conducted over computers, tablets, smartphones, 
               and other smart devices. Nearly every imaginable product and service is available through ecommerce 
               transactions, including books, music, plane tickets, and financial services
               such as stock investing and online banking. As such, it is considered a very disruptive technology. Ecommerce
                has helped businesses (especially those with a narrow reach like small businesses) gain access to and
                 establish a wider market presence by providing cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for 
                 their products or services. Target (TGT) supplemented its brick-and-mortar presence with an online store
                  that allows customers to purchase everything from clothes and coffeemakers to toothpaste and action figures
                   right from their homes.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">Ecommerce operates in all four of the following major market segments. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business to business (B2B), which is the direct sale of goods and services between businesses</li>
<li>Business to consumer (B2C), which involves sales between businesses and their customers</li>
<li>Consumer to consumer, which allows individuals to sell to one another, usually through a third-party site like eBay</li>
<li>Consumer to business, which lets individuals sell to businesses, such as an artist selling or licensing their artwork for use by a corporation</li>
</ul>
